### **Chapter 1: The God of Small Things**

The smell hit him first. A coppery tang of blood layered over the sterile bite of antiseptic, the faint, sour scent of fear, and the cloying sweetness of the industrial-grade air freshener fighting a losing battle against it all. To Dr. Alex Carter, it was the smell of a Tuesday night. The perfume of futility.

The Emergency Department of City General was a maelstrom of controlled chaos, a phrase Alex had once heard a first-year resident use with wide-eyed admiration. For Alex, after ten years on the front lines, the chaos felt far more dominant than the control. He moved through it with an economy of motion born of exhaustion and experience, his expression a practiced mask of professional calm hiding the erosion within.

“Dr. Carter, Trauma Two! MVA, pediatric patient, ETA two minutes.”

The charge nurse’s voice cut through the din of beeping monitors, the wheezing cough from curtained Bay 6, and the frantic Spanish of a family huddled by the vending machines.

Alex nodded, stripping off his gloves and tossing them into a biohazard bin. “What are we looking at?”

“Six-year-old female, passenger in a T-bone collision. Unrestrained. GCS of eight, signs of internal bleeding, and a possible C-spine injury. Vitals are all over the map.”

*Unrestrained.* The word hung in the air, thick and ugly. Alex’s jaw tightened. He pushed through the double doors into the trauma bay, the brighter lights making him squint. The team was already assembled, a blur of blue scrubs and focused tension.

“Alright, people, let’s be ready,” Alex commanded, his voice low and steady. “Airway cart at the head. Get me a full panel, cross-match four units of O-neg. On my count.”

The two minutes stretched into an eternity, then snapped shut as paramedics burst through the ambulance bay doors. On the gurney was a small form, terrifyingly still, dwarfed by the neck brace and the oxygen mask that fogged with each shallow breath. A pink unicorn sticker was peeling from the side of her sneaker.

A familiar, cold stone settled in Alex’s gut. He hated pediatric traumas. They weren’t just tragic; they were a brutal refutation of any notion of fairness or order in the universe.

The next twenty minutes were a frenzy of precise, desperate activity. “No breath sounds on the left!” “Pressure’s dropping, sixty over forty!” “She’s crashing, push another amp of epi!”

Alex worked with a detached fury, his hands sure and swift as he inserted a chest tube. The hiss of released air and the gush of dark blood was a small, grim victory. He called out orders, interpreted scans on the monitor, and tried to piece together the shattered little body before him. It was like trying to hold water in his hands. For every leak he plugged, another sprang.

Finally, after a flatline that lasted two agonizing minutes, he had to call it.

“Time of death, 22:47.”

The room deflated. The frantic energy bled away, leaving a vacuum of silent, shared failure. Nurses began to quietly clean instruments. The resident who had been bagging the girl stared at his hands, his youthful bravado gone.

Alex stood for a moment, his gaze fixed on the unicorn sticker. He saw not a patient, but a cosmic joke. A six-year-old girl, full of life and magic and a belief in unicorns, was dead because someone ran a red light. Where was the grand design in that? Where was the benevolent, all-powerful deity who was supposed to care about the fall of a single sparrow? He was certainly nowhere to be found in Trauma Two.

Stripping off his bloody gloves and gown, Alex walked toward the family consultation room. This was the part of the job he loathed more than the blood and the death itself: the delivery of the verdict.

He found the mother and father huddled together on a small, worn-out sofa. They looked up as he entered, their faces a ruin of hope and terror.

Before he could speak, a woman stood from a chair in the corner. She was of average height, with kind eyes and hair pulled back in a simple bun. She wore no scrubs, just a simple blouse and slacks with a hospital ID badge that read: *Sarah Jenkins, Chaplaincy*.

“Doctor,” she said softly, her voice a calm island in their storm of grief.

Alex gave her a curt nod. He had no time for chaplains, the purveyors of platitudes, offering empty reassurances about heaven and God’s mysterious ways. They were selling a product he knew to be fraudulent.

He turned his attention to the parents. He delivered the news in the gentle, direct language the hospital required. He avoided euphemisms. He was clear. He was concise. He watched the hope in their eyes shatter and turn into an agony so profound it became a physical presence in the small room.

The mother let out a wail that clawed at the walls, a sound of pure, animalistic pain. The father just folded in on himself, his body shaking with silent sobs.

Alex had nothing more to offer. He had done his job. He mumbled his condolences, a hollow, meaningless phrase, and turned to leave.

As he reached the door, the chaplain, Sarah, spoke again. “Dr. Carter?”

He paused, his hand on the handle, without turning.

“Thank you for everything you did,” she said. “You fought for her.”

Her words were simple. There was no mention of God’s will, no talk of angels. Just an acknowledgment of his effort. It was so unexpected that it pierced his armor of cynicism for a brief moment. He didn’t know how to respond.

So he said nothing. He pushed the door open and walked back into the chaos, the mother’s cries following him down the hall like a judgment.

### **Chapter 2: The Anatomy of a Scar**

The drive home was a silent, gray affair. The city lights smeared across Alex’s windshield, a blurred canvas of a world he no longer saw in color. He lived in a minimalist apartment that was less a home and more a holding cell between shifts—clean, sparse, and empty.

He bypassed the kitchen, heading straight for the liquor cabinet. He poured a generous measure of single-malt scotch into a heavy glass, the amber liquid catching the dim light. He drank not for oblivion, but for distance. Tonight, the edges of his world were razor-sharp.

The unicorn sticker. That’s what kept replaying in his mind, a tiny, insignificant detail that held the weight of a life. He’d seen so much death, so much random, senseless suffering, that he had long ago performed a clinical dissection of his own faith, cutting away the diseased tissue of belief until nothing remained but the cold, hard logic of a material world.

He sank onto his leather sofa, the glass cool against his hand. His gaze drifted to the single framed photograph on the bookshelf, the only personal item in the room. A woman with a radiant smile stood next to a younger, happier version of himself. Between them, a boy of about seven, with Alex’s dark hair and the woman’s bright eyes, was missing his two front teeth and grinning as if he’d just discovered the secret of the universe.

*Anna and Leo.*

The scotch burned its way down his throat. The scar on his soul wasn’t from the cumulative trauma of the ER; it was from a single event, a single point in time that had fractured his world. A drunk driver. A car that looked eerily similar to the one from the MVA report tonight. One survivor.

He had been the one to pull his own son from the wreckage. He had performed CPR on the side of the road, his hands pressing on the small chest of his own child while his wife lay motionless in the driver’s seat. He was a doctor, and he had been utterly helpless. Leo survived. Anna did not.

That was twelve years ago. Leo was nineteen now, a freshman in college studying physics—a world of elegant equations and predictable forces, the polar opposite of his father’s. Their relationship was a polite, strained truce. Alex had never been able to bridge the chasm that had opened that day. How could he teach his son about a world he himself no longer understood? How could he offer comfort when he possessed none?

The funeral had been a blur of well-meaning people offering the very platitudes he now despised. *She’s in a better place. God has a plan. He needed another angel.* Each phrase had felt like a physical blow. He had stood by the graveside, a hollow man, listening to a priest talk about a loving God who watches over His children. Alex had wanted to scream. What kind of loving father allows this?

He took another long swallow of scotch. He was tired with a deep, soul-level exhaustion that sleep couldn’t touch. On a whim, driven by a masochistic impulse he didn’t fully understand, he picked up his tablet from the coffee table. He opened a browser, his fingers hovering over the keyboard before typing the question that had been the silent, screaming backdrop to his life for over a decade.

*Why does God allow suffering?*

The search results flooded the screen: articles, forums, sermons. He clicked the first link, a site with a simple name: GotQuestions.org. His eyes scanned the text. It spoke of free will, of the fallen nature of the world, of sin entering creation. It mentioned Job. It talked about suffering producing perseverance, character, and hope.

Alex let out a short, bitter laugh. Perseverance. Character. Hope. He felt he had none of those things, only scar tissue. He read about how God’s perspective is higher than man’s, how His ways are not our ways. It was all so neat, so tidy. A theological answer key for a test no one signed up to take. It was an explanation, but it wasn’t an answer. An explanation is an intellectual exercise. An answer is what a father gives his crying child in the middle of the night.

He slammed the tablet down on the cushion beside him, the noise startlingly loud in the silent apartment. It was all just words. Anesthesia for the masses. He finished his drink, the warmth doing little to dispel the chill that had taken root in his soul twelve years ago and never left. He was a man who fixed broken bodies, yet his own spirit was a wound that would not close.

### **Chapter 3: An Unwanted Dialogue**

Three days later, the ghost of the pediatric trauma still lingered in the corners of the ER. A new wave of broken bones, chest pains, and mysterious fevers had washed through, but the memory remained. Alex was finishing a suture on a teenager who’d had a misadventure with a skateboard when his pager beeped.

*Chaplain Jenkins requests a moment. Staff lounge.*

Alex gritted his teeth. He had actively avoided her since that night, his path through the hospital a carefully curated map of detours. He had no interest in a post-mortem of his spiritual health. He considered ignoring the page, but that would be unprofessional. Worse, it would feel like cowardice.

He found her in the staff lounge, sitting at a small table with two cups of what smelled like actual, non-machine coffee. For a rare moment, the room was empty.

“Dr. Carter,” she said, her smile small and unthreatening. “I brought you a coffee. Figured you could use a real one.”

He remained standing by the door, his arms crossed. “I’m busy, Sarah.”

“I know,” she said, her calm unruffled. “That’s why I only asked for a moment. Please.” She gestured to the chair opposite her.

With a sigh that broadcast his reluctance, Alex sat. The coffee did smell good. He took the cup, the warmth seeping into his perpetually cold hands.

“I’m not here to ambush you with a Bible verse, Doctor,” she began, as if reading his mind. “I just wanted to follow up. That night… that was a hard one. For everyone. I wanted to see how *you* were doing.”

The question caught him off guard. People asked if he was tired or hungry, but no one ever asked how he was *doing*.

“I’m fine,” he said, the word a reflex. “It’s the job.”

Sarah nodded, taking a slow sip of her coffee. She didn’t push, just watched him with an unnerving stillness. It wasn’t a stare, but a gaze of quiet attention that made him feel seen in a way that was deeply uncomfortable.

“The family,” she said after a moment. “The girl’s parents. They asked me to thank you again. They said they could see how hard you fought for her.”

Alex flinched. “We lost her. There’s no consolation prize for effort.”

“To them, there is,” Sarah countered gently. “Knowing she wasn’t alone, that someone was in her corner until the very end… that matters. It doesn’t fix the hole in their lives, but it keeps the edges from being quite so jagged.”

Alex looked down into his coffee cup, at the black, bitter liquid. “And what did you tell them, Chaplain? That it was God’s plan? That their daughter is an angel now?” The sarcasm was a shield he wielded with expertise.

Sarah’s expression remained open, compassionate. “No. I told them it was okay to be angry at God. I told them it was okay to scream and curse and ask why. I told them their hearts were broken and that God wasn’t afraid of their brokenness.” She paused, her eyes meeting his. “Mostly, I just sat with them. And I listened.”

This was not what Alex had expected. He had come armed for a theological debate, ready to dismantle every flimsy argument. But she wasn’t offering arguments. She was offering presence.

“Why?” Alex asked, the question sharper than he intended. “Why do a job like that? Offering comfort for a tragedy orchestrated by the very being you represent?”

“I don’t believe God orchestrates tragedy, Doctor,” she said softly. “I believe He enters into it with us. I don’t have an easy answer for why a six-year-old girl dies. I don’t think there is one. Anyone who gives you a neat, tidy answer is selling something. But I believe that God’s heart was the first one to break in that trauma bay.”

Alex stared at her, a torrent of unspoken arguments rising in his throat. *Free will? A fallen world? Where was He when my wife died?* But the words wouldn’t come. Her quiet sincerity had disarmed him.

He said nothing, merely shaking his head as if to clear it. He stood, the chair scraping against the linoleum.

“I have to get back to work,” he said, the words an excuse for retreat.

“Alex,” she said, and her use of his first name now felt like an invitation, not a trespass. He stopped but didn’t turn.

“The questions you have,” she said, her voice filled with an empathy that felt dangerously real. “They aren’t signs of a lack of faith. They’re signs you’re still searching for a faith that’s strong enough to hold the weight of your pain. If you ever want to talk about it… not as a doctor and a chaplain, but just as two people who have seen too much… my door is always open.”

He walked out of the lounge without another word, the scent of real coffee following him. He was annoyed, unsettled, and strangely, for the first time in a very long time, not entirely alone in his anger. He had come expecting a fight and had instead been handed an invitation. He had no idea what to do with it.
