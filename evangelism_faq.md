# 15 Key Questions & Answers on Christianity

This document provides concise, biblically-sound answers to common questions about the Christian faith.  Scripture references are provided for further study.

**1. What is the meaning of life according to Christianity?**

The meaning of life according to Christianity is to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:37-40).  This involves living a life pleasing to God, fulfilling His purpose for your life, and experiencing a relationship with Him.  Ultimately, it's about knowing and experiencing God's love and sharing that love with others.

**2. How can I know if God is real?**

The existence of God is a matter of faith. While scientific proof is impossible, many find evidence for God's existence through personal experiences, the complexity and order of the universe (Romans 1:20), the testimony of others, and the transformative power of faith.  A sincere seeking of God can lead to a personal encounter with Him.

**3. What is the nature of God (e.g., Trinity, attributes)?**

God is one being existing in three co-equal, co-eternal persons: Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:16-17; 2 Corinthians 13:14).  God's attributes include omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing), omnipresence (everywhere present), holiness, justice, love, mercy, and grace.

**4. How does Christianity explain the problem of evil and suffering?**

Christianity acknowledges the reality of evil and suffering.  While a full explanation is beyond human comprehension, the Bible attributes evil to humanity's rebellion against God (Genesis 3) and the consequences of sin. God, in His love, offers salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ, providing hope and comfort amidst suffering.  Suffering can also refine character and deepen faith.

**5. What is the significance of Jesus Christ and his death and resurrection?**

Jesus Christ is the Son of God, fully God and fully man. His death on the cross atoned for the sins of humanity (Romans 5:8), paying the penalty for our wrongdoing. His resurrection demonstrates His victory over death and sin, offering hope of eternal life to those who believe in Him (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

**6. What is salvation, and how can I receive it?**

Salvation is the deliverance from sin and its consequences, resulting in reconciliation with God and the promise of eternal life. It's received through faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice (Ephesians 2:8-9). This involves repentance for sin and a commitment to follow Christ.

**7. What does the Bible say about [specific moral issue, e.g., homosexuality, abortion]?**

The Bible condemns sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:9-10) and the taking of innocent human life (Exodus 20:13).  Interpretations vary, but many Christians believe these passages speak against homosexual acts and abortion.  However, the approach to these issues should be one of grace, love, and compassion, reflecting the heart of Christ.

**8. How can I reconcile faith with science?**

Faith and science are not mutually exclusive. Science explores the "how" of the universe, while faith explores the "why."  Many Christians see God as the creator and sustainer of the universe, with science helping us understand His creation.  Areas of apparent conflict often stem from misinterpretations or limitations in our current understanding.

**9. Is Christianity compatible with other religions or worldviews?**

Christianity holds a unique claim to truth regarding salvation through Jesus Christ.  However, Christians can engage in respectful dialogue with people of other faiths, recognizing common ground and shared values while maintaining the distinctiveness of their beliefs.

**10. What is the role of the Church in the world?**

The Church is the body of Christ, called to be a light to the world (Matthew 5:14-16), proclaiming the Gospel, demonstrating God's love through service and compassion, and working for justice and peace.

**11. How should Christians live their lives in accordance with their faith?**

Christians should strive to live lives characterized by love, humility, obedience to God's word, and service to others (Galatians 5:22-23). This includes ethical conduct in all aspects of life, reflecting the values of the Kingdom of God.

**12. What is the nature of heaven and hell?**

Heaven is described as a place of eternal fellowship with God and perfect bliss, while hell is a place of eternal separation from God and suffering.  The specifics are not fully revealed in Scripture, but these concepts highlight the ultimate consequences of choosing for or against God.

**13. How can I overcome sin and temptation?**

Overcoming sin and temptation involves relying on God's grace, studying Scripture, prayer, fellowship with other believers, and actively resisting temptation (James 4:7).  The Holy Spirit empowers believers to live a life pleasing to God.

**14. What is the purpose of prayer, and how does it work?**

Prayer is communication with God, expressing worship, thanksgiving, confession, and requests.  It's not about manipulating God but about deepening our relationship with Him.  God answers prayers according to His will and timing, often working through circumstances to accomplish His purposes.

**15. How can I grow in my faith and deepen my relationship with God?**

Growing in faith involves consistent Bible study, prayer, fellowship with other believers, service to others, and seeking God's will in all aspects of life.  Surrendering to God's leading and allowing Him to transform your heart are crucial aspects of this process.
