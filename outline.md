      "content": "# Lesson 1: The Alphabet & Core Pronunciation\n\nThis lesson introduces the French alphabet and fundamental pronunciation rules.  We'll focus on sounds that differ significantly from English.\n\n## The French Alphabet\n\nThe French alphabet is largely the same as the English alphabet, with a few additions: \n\n* **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**\n\n## Key Pronunciation Differences\n\n* **Nasal Vowels:** French has nasal vowels (sounds produced with air escaping through the nose). We will practice these sounds: `an`, `en`, `in`, `on`, `un`.\n* **R:** The French 'r' is a guttural sound, produced in the back of the throat.  We will practice this sound and its variations.\n* **Liaison:** This is the linking of sounds between words. We'll look at common examples.\n* **Silent Letters:** Many letters are silent in French. We'll identify common instances.\n\n## Practice Activities\n\n* **Alphabet recitation:** Practice saying the alphabet aloud.\n* **Sound discrimination:** Listen to audio examples of nasal vowels and the 'r' sound, and practice distinguishing them.\n* **Minimal pairs:** Practice distinguishing words that differ only by one sound (e.g., *vin* (wine) and *vain* (vain)).\n* **Reading practice:** Read aloud short sentences containing the sounds we've learned.\n* **Pronunciation exercises:** Work on improving your pronunciation through repetition and feedback."
