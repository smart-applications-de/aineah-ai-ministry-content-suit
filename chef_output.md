## Meal Plan 1: A Classic Roman Feast


### Appetizer: Supplì (Fried Rice Balls)

**Description:** Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, these Roman-style fried rice balls are a delightful explosion of flavors. The savory tomato ragu, creamy mozzarella, and fragrant parsley encased in a perfectly golden crust create an irresistible appetizer.

Style:  Photorealistic food photography, reminiscent of a high-end Italian cookbook.


**Yields:** 12 supplì
**Prep time:** 30 minutes
**Cook time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups Arborio rice
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup tomato ragu (meat or vegan)
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella (or vegan mozzarella)
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or nutritional yeast for vegan)
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten (or flax eggs for vegan: 1 tbsp flaxseed meal + 3 tbsp water per egg)
* Breadcrumbs
* Vegetable oil, for frying
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Cook the rice: In a large saucepan, bring the vegetable broth to a boil. Add the rice and cook according to package directions, until al dente. Drain any excess liquid.
2. Sauté aromatics: While the rice cooks, sauté the onion and garlic in a pan until softened. Stir in the tomato ragu and cook for 5 minutes.
3. Combine ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the cooked rice, ragu, mozzarella, Parmesan (or nutritional yeast), and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool slightly.
4. Shape the supplì: Shape the rice mixture into small balls (about 1.5 inches in diameter). Make a small indentation in the center of each ball.
5. Bread the supplì: Dip each rice ball in the beaten eggs, then coat thoroughly in breadcrumbs.
6. Fry the supplì: Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Carefully fry the supplì in batches until golden brown and crispy (about 3-4 minutes per side).
7. Drain and serve: Remove the supplì from the pan and place them on a wire rack to drain excess oil. Serve immediately.



### Main Course: Cacio e Pepe

**Description:** This Roman classic is a symphony of simplicity. Perfectly cooked spaghetti is tossed with a generous amount of Pecorino Romano cheese and freshly cracked black pepper, creating a creamy, intensely flavorful sauce that will leave you wanting more.

**Instructions:**

1. Cook the pasta: Cook the spaghetti according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup of pasta water before draining.
2. Combine ingredients: Add the cooked pasta to a large bowl. Add the Pecorino Romano cheese (or vegan alternative), black pepper, and a pinch of salt. Toss to combine.
3. Add pasta water: Gradually add the reserved pasta water, tossing constantly until the sauce is creamy and coats the pasta.
4. Serve immediately.



### Dessert: Biscotti

**Description:** These twice-baked almond biscotti are the perfect accompaniment to a cup of espresso.  Crunchy, subtly sweet, and with a delightful almond crunch, they are a classic Italian treat that will satisfy any sweet craving.

**Yields:** 12 biscotti
**Prep time:** 15 minutes
**Cook time:** 30 minutes

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder

* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened (or vegan butter)
* 2 large eggs (or flax eggs as above)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 cup sliced almonds

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. Cream butter and sugar: In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Add eggs and vanilla: Beat in the eggs (or flax eggs) one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
5. Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the almonds.
6. Shape the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide.
7. Bake the first time: Place the dough log on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. Cool and slice: Let the log cool completely on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F (150°C).
