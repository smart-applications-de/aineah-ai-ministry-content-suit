          "text": "# Lesson 1: The Alphabet & Core Pronunciation\n\nWelcome to your French language learning journey! This first lesson will introduce you to the French alphabet and fundamental pronunciation rules. Mastering these basics is crucial for your progress.\n\n## The French Alphabet\nThe French alphabet is very similar to the English alphabet, with a few extra characters:\n\n* **a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z**\n\n* **ç:**  pronounced like the 's' in 'pleasure'\n* **é, è, ê, ë:** pronounced like the 'ay' in 'say', but with slight variations depending on the accent.\n* **à, â, ä:** pronounced like the 'a' in 'father' with slight variations.\n* **î, ï, î:** pronounced like the 'ee' in 'see' with slight variations.\n* **ô, ö, û, ü:** pronounced with a rounded sound, similar to 'oo' but different.\n\n## Core Pronunciation\nFrench pronunciation can be tricky for English speakers, but with practice, you'll get the hang of it. Here are some key points:\n\n* **Nasal Vowels:** French has nasal vowels, which are pronounced through the nose.  Practice these sounds carefully.\n* **Liaison:**  This involves linking the final consonant of one word to the initial vowel of the next word.  This is a key feature of spoken French.\n* **Stress:** Unlike English, French words generally don't have strong stress on a particular syllable.  The emphasis is more even.\n\n## Activities\n\n* **Alphabet Practice:** Write out the French alphabet several times. \n* **Pronunciation Practice:** Listen to audio recordings of the alphabet and try to imitate the pronunciation.  Focus on the nasal vowels and liaison.\n* **Vocabulary Introduction:** Learn basic greetings (Bonjour, Bonsoir, Salut) and farewells (Au revoir, À bientôt).\n* **Quiz:** Test your knowledge of the alphabet and basic pronunciation with a short quiz."
